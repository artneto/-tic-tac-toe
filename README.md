# -tic-tac-toe

Welcome to my second milestone project. I chose to make my own version of the Tic Tac Toe game for this project because I like challenge, consequently I believe this is the best choice for me.

The project is developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

[**View Tic Tac Toe website here!**](https://artneto.github.io/-tic-tac-toe/)

The users  for this game will be assigned as Player X and will play against the computer - Player O selecting the square you want to put your X into by clicking in the box. The first player to get three squares in a row wins.

This site will be targeted at people of all ages with the intention of providing excellent practice in problem solving, analytical thinking, spatial reasoning, deduction, and strategy.
