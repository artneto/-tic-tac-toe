# -tic-tac-toe

Welcome to my second milestone project. I chose to make my own version of the Tic Tac Toe game for this project because I like challenge, consequently I believe this is the best choice for me.

The project is developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The users  for this game will be assigned as Player X and will play against the computer - Player O selecting the square you want to put your X into by clicking in the box. The first player to get three squares in a row wins.
